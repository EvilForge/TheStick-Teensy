I'd welcome any help or comments. 
I'm not a full time programmer/developer, nor am I a certified Electrical Engineer. But I like making stuff!
Most of my learning came from the community, adapted by me to fit my needs (because thats exactly what youre
supposed to do with open source right?).
So I'd expect the same from you. 

While i don't offer support for this project, if you catch me in the right mood i might be willing to help some.. 

And in the same mindset, I would hope you see my content here as just parts you can pick and choose from your your project.

Feel free to share your updates or changes you found when doing something similar to my project.
